/**
 * Contact Time Zone Checker is a utility program that simulates a smart
 * contacts
 * application which considers time zones before placing calls. The program
 * helps
 * users make informed decisions about calling contacts in different time zones
 * by checking if it might be too late at the contact's location.
 * 
 * The program manages three contacts in different time zones:
 * - Contact 1: Pacific Standard Time (PST, user's time zone)
 * - Contact 2: Central Standard Time (CST, +2 hours from PST)
 * - Contact 3: Eastern Standard Time (EST, +3 hours from PST)
 * 
 * If a user attempts to call when it's past 9:00 PM in the contact's time zone,
 * the program will warn the user and ask for confirmation before proceeding
 * with
 * the call.
